<h2><p style="color:red;"><u>Three reasons to go to a Summer Camp</u></p></h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3><p style="color:blue;"><u>BUILD FRIENDSHIPS</u></p></h3>
	
    <p>In the unplugged, tech and stress free, fun camp culture, teens build their face-to-face communication and relationship skills. Campers learn to work together, accept each other’s differences, and find ways to<strong> cooperate, collaborate and communicate </strong>. Aside from providing the opportunity to generate incredible memories and create ‘friends for life’, these skills will be essential to have for future employers.</p>

    <h3><p style="color:orange;"><u>DISCOVER YOUR BEST SELF</u></p></h3>
    <p>In summer camps teens have the chance to step back from the treadmill of school, study, exams, competitive sports, and an over-scheduled existence to learn and focus on what is important to them.<br>It is an opportunity to discover new hobbies, skills they didn’t know they had and with a view to exploring future career paths. Students will enjoy physical and mental challenges that focus on <strong><br>personal development and build confidence </strong> from the inside and out.</p>
